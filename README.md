# MathExos

## Description

MathExos is a web application to generate random mathematics exercises.

Factorize polynomials, find roots, compute derivatives, compute function variation tables, solve linear systems.
The solutions are provided with beautiful analytic expressions in Latex.

It  generates editable Latex documents for the problem page for the students, and a solution document.
These documents can be compiled online to PDF in one click using Overleaf.

The application is multi language and supports currently: Arabic, Chinease, English, French, German, Italian, Polish.
It is very easy to add a new language so if you have the need please ask!

It is a full open source and web application, based on Python, streamlit, symbolic calculations.

## Getting Started

The easyest way is to use the online [streamlit application ](https://mathexos.streamlit.app/):
